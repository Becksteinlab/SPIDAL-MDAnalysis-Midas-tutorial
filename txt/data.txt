AdK
===

There are AdK DIMS trajectories (both closed to open and open to
closed) and corresponding topology are, respectively, in::

   /nfs/homes3/sseyler/Projects/Enzymes/AdK/simulations/enhanced/DIMS/trj
   /nfs/homes3/sseyler/Projects/Enzymes/AdK/simulations/enhanced/DIMS/top

(The subdirectories "core" will have core-aligned trajectories.)

For FRODA, you'll see the relevant top/trj files in::

   /nfs/homes3/sseyler/Simulations/adk/gp/top
   /nfs/homes3/sseyler/Simulations/adk/gp/trj/co/fit/core
   /nfs/homes3/sseyler/Simulations/adk/gp/trj/oc/fit/core

If you don't want fitted trajectories, look for directories named
"raw", as they should contain trajectories that haven't been
pre-aligned.


Diptheria toxin

All trajectories under::

   /nfs/homes3/sseyler/Simulations/dt

with similar naming conventions.
